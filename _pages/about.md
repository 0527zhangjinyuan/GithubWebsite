# Welcome!

 I am an Assistant Professor of Finance at <a href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty-and-research/finance" target="_blank">UCLA Anderson School of Management</a>.  
 
 
 My research interests lie in the area of financial intermediation, including banking, pension funds, and mutual funds. I am particularly interested in understanding the impact of macro-level policies on micro-level behaviors and the subsequent economic consequences.
