US public state pension deficits are very large, accounting for 18.5% of an average state's GDP and up to 50% in Illinois.
In principle, households should respond to this heavy future burden by increasing current savings, particularly in safe assets, since pension deficits are countercyclical.
Comparing households residing on opposing sides of a state's border, I document that households in larger-deficit states save more, investing more in safe bank deposits and less in risky stocks.
Specifically, households hold 0.70 dollars more in deposits and 0.33 dollars less in stocks for each additional dollar of pension deficit.
This effect strengthened further following the implementation of new accounting standards in 2015 that made deficits more salient by requiring states to publicly disclose them.
Exploiting staggered state pension reforms, I also find that households respond consistently when states reduce pension deficits; they decrease deposits and increase stock holdings. These reallocations spill over onto local economic activity: as households withdraw deposits following a pension reform, exposed local banks cut lending to local businesses.

              This paper studies how banks compete amid digital disruption and the resulting distributional effect across consumers. Digital disruption increases the geographic coverage of banking services, bringing new entrants to local markets. However, as digital customers shift from branches to digital services, banks close branches, and the remaining branching banks gain market power among non-digital customers that rely on branches. Consequently, digital customers benefit from the intensified bank competition at the cost of non-digital customers who pay higher prices for branch services and face the risk of financial exclusion. We provide empirical evidence by exploiting the staggered expansion of 3G networks, instrumented by regional distribution of lightning strike frequency. Using a structural model, we further quantitatively decompose the benefit and costs of digital disruption resulting from banks' pricing, branching, and entry decisions. The results highlight the role of banks' endogenous responses to digital disruption in widening the gap in access to banking services.

          We provide a theoretical framework to understand the implications of corporate governance on the composition of the asset management industry and financial markets. We allow investors to implement corporate governance in an otherwise standard information model. Our model generates new strategic complementarities in investors’ decisions to acquire information due to a conflict of interest between active and passive investors arsing from their information asymmetry. Such strategic complementarities contrast the traditional substitution role of information, and we provide empirical predictions unique to our model based on comparative statics. Our results are robust to various approaches that passive investors can take to participate in corporate governance, and we discuss the policymakers’ trade-offs when regulating their participation. We apply our insights to two critical passive funds’ governance issues: ESG policies and product market competition from common ownership.        </p>

            This paper examines flow patterns in corporate bond mutual funds under different monetary policy environments. We build a model of runs in funds with uncertain future interest rates, uncovering a novel outflow-to-interest-rate relationship. Consistent with the model's predictions, we empirically find that (i) outflows from funds increase when the target Fed funds rate increases, (ii) the outflow-to-interest-rate sensitivity is stronger under more accommodative and uncertain monetary policy environments, and (iii) these monetary-policy-induced flow sensitivities are greater when the bond market is more liquid. Our results suggest that fragility in corporate bond funds could be an important unintended consequence of monetary policy.

            This paper uncovers a novel phenomenon of flight-to-Bitcoin (FTB) whereby local demand for Bitcoin increases with local economic policy uncertainties. FTB holds across Bitcoin demand proxies including local premiums over the US market, turnover, and web traffic on cryptocurrency exchanges. We find that FTB is mainly driven by a lack of confidence in local authorities. Consistent with this interpretation, FTB is stronger during corruption incidents and Bitcoin ownership shifts from centralized exchanges to decentralized wallets amid turbulence. A comparison with safe-haven assets further differentiates FTB from other forms of flight-to-safety. The evidence collectively illustrates one overlooked motivation of Bitcoin investment: investors hold Bitcoin to mitigate their concerns about local authorities.

            This paper develops a structural model to examine high-frequency price dynamics. The key innovation is to allow trades' permanent price impact to be time-varying—dynamic trade informativeness. A distribution-free filtering technique pins the real-world data to the model. The filtered series (i) significantly recover the efficient price innovation through the dynamics of trade informativeness, (ii) improve trades' explanatory power for future returns, (iii) distinguish informativeness from trades' aggressiveness, (iv) gauge informed investors' patience, and (v) capture systematic patterns around scheduled and unscheduled events, as well as general intraday trends. The framework contributes to the better utilization of high-frequency trading data.         </p>

    [6]. <strong>The Rise of Passive Funds Triggers Active Fund Consolidation</strong><br>

    <li>Summary: The rise of passive investing can trigger active funds to consolidate (T) </li>

      Consolidation among active asset management funds surged in 2016. What triggered this new wave of consolidation? Using a noisy rational expectation model with imperfect competition, we show that the rise of passive investing can explain the new change. As the number of passive funds grows, the asset market becomes more liquid. As a result, the rents extracted from noise traders shrink and the competition among active funds becomes more intense. These effects squeeze down the expected profit margins of active funds, hence stimulating them to form a coalition to gain monopolistic trading power. I show that the rise of passive investing affects market outcomes (liquidity, price informativeness and volatility) through fund consolidation, and hence it is essential to control for active funds consolidation when examining the (casual) relationship between passive investing and market outcomes.

            The global financial crisis of 2007–2009 revealed the great extent to which systemic risk can jeopardize the stability of the entire financial system. An effective methodology to quantify systemic risk is at the heart of the process of identifying the so-called systemically important financial institutions for regulatory purposes as well as to investigate key drivers of systemic contagion. The article proposes a method for dynamic forecasting of CoVaR, a popular measure of systemic risk. As a first step, we develop a semi-parametric framework using asymptotic results in the spirit of extreme value theory (EVT) to model the conditional probability distribution of a bivariate random vector given that one of the components takes on a large value, taking into account important features of financial data such as asymmetry and heavy tails. In the second step, we embed the proposed EVT method into a dynamic framework via a bivariate GARCH process. An empirical analysis is conducted to demonstrate and compare the performance of the proposed methodology relative to a very flexible fully parametric alternative. </p>

             Nelsen et al. (2004) find bounds for bivariate distribution functions when there are constraints on the values of its quartiles. Tankov (2011) generalizes this work by giving explicit expressions for the best upper and lower bounds for a bivariate copula when its values on a compact subset of [0; 1]<sup>2</sup> are known. He shows that they are quasi-copulas and not necessarily copulas. Tankov (2011) and Bernard et al. (2012) both give sufficient conditions for these bounds to be copulas. In this note we give weaker sufficient conditions to ensure that both bounds are simultaneously copulas. Furthermore, we develop a novel application to quantitative risk management by computing bounds on a bivariate risk measure. This can be useful in optimal portfolio selection, in reinsurance, in pricing bivariate derivatives or in determining capital requirements when only partial information on dependence is available. </p>
